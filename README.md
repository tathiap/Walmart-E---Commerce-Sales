# Walmart E-Commerce Customer Behavior Analysis

This repository showcases two end-to-end data analytics projects built to demonstrate the power of combining exploratory analysis, A/B testing, segmentation, forecasting, and predictive modeling to drive business insights in real-world consumer data.


## Project 1: Walmart E-Commerce Customer Analysis
Overview
This project explores Walmart's e-commerce customer behavior through a full-stack analytics workflow. It combines exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, A/B testing, forecasting, and predictive modeling to generate insights that can inform strategic marketing and personalization efforts.

Objectives
* Understand purchase patterns across demographic groups.
* Segment users using K-Means clustering.
* Evaluate marketing/test effects through A/B testing.
* Forecast future revenue using Prophet and ARIMA.
* Predict high-value customers using logistic regression and Bayesian modeling.

Key Components
* EDA: Distribution plots, outlier filtering, and group-based purchase summaries.
* Segmentation: K-Means clustering with PCA visualization and label assignment.
* A/B Testing: Classical t-tests and segment-specific testing with power analysis.
* Forecasting: Time-series modeling using Prophet and ARIMA.
* Predictive Modeling: Logistic regression + ROC AUC, and Bayesian analysis via PyMC.

The goal is to understand what drives purchases, segment users effectively for targeted marketing, and project revenue trends to support data driven business decisions.



## Project 2: Instacart Behavior & Marketing Optimization
Overview
This project analyzes Instacart grocery shopping data to uncover user behavior trends, evaluate A/B test impact, and build advanced predictive and causal models. The goal is to optimize retention, order frequency, and campaign effectiveness using modern data science techniques.

Objectives
* Conduct robust A/B tests (including uplift modeling).
* Perform time series forecasting on reorder rates.
* Segment customers for tailored marketing.
* Build interpretable probabilistic models for churn or retention.

Key Components
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Product preferences, reorder behavior, and user frequency patterns.
* A/B Testing: Classical, uplift modeling, and propensity score matching.
* Forecasting: ARIMA and Prophet for weekly order volume.
* Churn Prediction: Logistic regression, decision trees, and PyMC3 for Bayesian inference.
* SQL Analysis: Metrics computation and cohort queries.

Designed as a portfolio worthy project, it simulates how a data analyst or scientist might use statistical and machine learning tools to inform key product and marketing decisions in a tech driven retail environment.
